## Take Your Code For A Test Drive
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/testing.jpg" width="400px" align="right" hspace="10"> **Test Driven Development (TDD)** is a style of progamming where developers write tests to check their code _before_ writing the code itself. It's an industry-wide practice that increases efficiency by reducing bugs in the long term. We're going to be using TDD in several of our labs going forward, so this lesson will serve as a brief introduction to the process.
